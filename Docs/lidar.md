#### LIDAR

#### SF-45b
SF-45b is the current LIDAR Sensor that DRIFT currently uses is the SF-45b from LightWare. This sensor is the "The worldâ€™s smallest and lightest scanning microLiDAR" according to LightWare. 

This sensor connects directly with the Lightware studio desktop application where we can see it scan and log/save data
    Plug in and connect

#### Receiving data for C++
Within the [Project Guide](https://support.lightware.co.za/sf45b/#/quickstart) found on the Lightware website, we can find the USB/Serial protocol reference documentation

To find code that complements the documentation, locate the [company's repository](https://github.com/LightWare-Optoelectronics/lightwarelidar).

To work with our project, the Lightware comapny's repository has been [forked and updated](https://github.com/team-drift/lightwarelidar_forked.git). This fork is included in the project as a submodule located in /extern

^Here you will find useful code for the ROS Driver, specifically for SF45b and SF40 lidar sensing models

#### ROS
The Robot Operating System(ROS) provides libraries and tools to build robotic applications. ROS acts as the middle framework between the software and hardware. 

We are using ROS 1 in this project.

Lightware uses ROS for it's tools that may directly work with the Lidar Sensors

ROS work directly on onboard computers such as Jetsons, Arduinos...


##### Setting up ROS Driver 
For MAC Users - Here is a [link](https://medium.com/@shubhjain_007/ros-on-mac-silicon-m1-m2-updated-method-e87086d84e45) for easy ROS setup.
For others, locate the documentation for installation on [ROS' Website](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation).

Once in, the Catkin build system should come with ROS, Catkin's build system is automatically invoked in the Lightware forked repository cloned in /extern


#### Run
Open new terminal, open ROS here as well
run ```roscore```

Plug in Lidar sensor to computer, confirm port name is same as included in lightwarelidar_forked, include the DRIFT built class (SF45Communicate) in a project, build, and run
