#### LIDAR


#### SF-45b
SF-45b is the current LIDAR Sensor that DRIFT currently uses is the SF-45b from LightWare. This sensor is the "The worldâ€™s smallest and lightest scanning microLiDAR" according to LightWare. 

This sensor connects directly with Lightware studio desktop application where we can see it scan and log/save data
    Plug in and connect

#### Receiving data for C++
Within the [Project Guide](https://support.lightware.co.za/sf45b/#/quickstart) found on the Lightware website, we can find the USB/Serial protocol reference documentation

To find code that complements the documentation, locate the [company's repository](https://github.com/LightWare-Optoelectronics/lightwarelidar)

^Here you will find useful code for the ROS Driver, specifically for SF45b and SF40 lidar sensing models


##### Setting up ROS Driver 
For MAC Users
    Here is a [link](https://medium.com/@shubhjain_007/ros-on-mac-silicon-m1-m2-updated-method-e87086d84e45) for easy ROS setup
For others, locate documentation on [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation)

Once in, the Catkin build system should come with ROS

within the lightware directory, downloaded from the repo previously, add this to the CMakeLists.txt

```
target_link_libraries(lwNx
  platformLinux
  serialPortLinux
)

target_link_libraries(platformLinux
  serialPortLinux
)
```

#### Run
Open new terminal, open ROS here as well
run ```roscore```

Plug in Lidar sensor to computer, make the project, run executable
